# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  Developers must be able to navigate DOM modeling so they can work on specific code issues.  Knowing tables is good because it's a rudimentary way of back up methods when our primaries are down.  Constuctors simply reduce time for productivity and lines of code for readability.  Flexbox is good to know for those beginner developers and bloggers.  It's a good starting point to understand the basics of how you can structure pages without always have to manipulate margins, borders, padding, and content manually.  Bloggers can add content to their pages easily to make them easily readible and add a little pop.  Personal business owners could also beneifit from learning flexbox as well.  They can save a little money being their own developer and graphic designer.  Learning forms helps developers interact and collect data from users.  Although collecting user data can become a rudimentary task, developers can manipulate forms to make them less boring or unappealing.  When users react to events, developers get an inside look at their behaviors.  This helps developers structure their pages to meet user needs, for example off the number of clicks, scrolls, or times a user visits urls.  ***Knowing how to debug code helps developers test processes before going live.  Working out small kinks goes a long way before deployment and degrading users' experiences.***

# Class 10 Assignment

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

  - Syntax errors are more spelling gaffes
  - Logical errors could be spelled correctly but just not make sense

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    - Syntax; make sure my code makes sense by listening to the linter
    - undefined; add calls to all undefined elements
    - formatting; make sure my code aligns correctly by using VsCode's formatting tool    

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

  I will defintely self study debugging more.  Being a good coder isn't going to be good enough because I'm sure there'll be time when I'm coding under deadlines or late into the night.  Mistakes will happen if I don't take the time to check and debug my code.

4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

  It's a built in browser tool of which to take advantage.   It's a headache saver versus getting into infinite loops and potentially breaking something.    

5. Define what a breakpoint is.

   They work to set up points to stop at to test functions before they're called in our broswer developer tools or text editor.

6. What is the call stack?

   A section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
