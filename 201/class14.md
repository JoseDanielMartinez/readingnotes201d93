# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  Developers must be able to navigate DOM modeling so they can work on specific code issues.  Knowing tables is good because it's a rudimentary way of back up methods when our primaries are down.  Constuctors simply reduce time for productivity and lines of code for readability.  Flexbox is good to know for those beginner developers and bloggers.  It's a good starting point to understand the basics of how you can structure pages without always have to manipulate margins, borders, padding, and content manually.  Bloggers can add content to their pages easily to make them easily readible and add a little pop.  Personal business owners could also beneifit from learning flexbox as well.  They can save a little money being their own developer and graphic designer.  Learning forms helps developers interact and collect data from users.  Although collecting user data can become a rudimentary task, developers can manipulate forms to make them less boring or unappealing.  When users react to events, developers get an inside look at their behaviors.  This helps developers structure their pages to meet user needs, for example off the number of clicks, scrolls, or times a user visits urls.  Knowing how to debug code helps developers test processes before going live.  Working out small kinks goes a long way before deployment and degrading users' experiences.  Video and audio technologies have transformed the web's accessibility in several ways.  Both alone have revolutionalized how we spend the majorities of our days, whether it be watching videos to pass time or listen to playlists while we work out on mobile devices.  Knowing how to leverage both types of mediums helps developers reach end users in their daily activities whether as consumers, students, or any other type of practioners.  CSS grid is another great area to master for just it's two-dimensional feature alone.  Aside from developers, its mastery can benefit other non-tech populations, e.g. small business owners, bloggers, and writers in creating simple webpage designs and layouts.  Aesthetics is an important factor when developing web pages.  Front end designers need to consider which methods best fit client side preferences when presenting data and other metrics.  It can be the difference that keeps stakeholders data focused versus visually distracted.  Using third party chart libraries, i.e. Chart.js could prove useful in acheiving client side favor, subscription, and overall return on investment.  Keeping local storage offers developers ways to access files without an internet connection, faster data transfers, cost savings versus purchasing cloud archives.  ***Mastering front end web developement skills is crucial for those that prefer client side interaction.  They offer ways to raise revenues and increase profit margins through useful engagement techniques, such as emphasis, visual allure, and animated story telling.  Additionally, it's a way to reach several markets using differing reach methods.***

## Class 14 Assignment

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

   It gives developers new ways to position and alter elements.  The transform property comes in two different settings; two and three dimensional.  They can alter elements to rotate, scale, skew, cube, etc.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

   A simple transform would be a 2D scale.  Here, developers can emphasis to an element.  So for example, if they had text on a page they wanted to stand out to the user, they could add 2D scale to have elements rotate on an axis.

3. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

   Developers have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

4. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

CSS Animations are more than transition single state changes.  They use multiple keyframes to alter elements' behaviors and appearances.

5. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

They excite users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase conversions.

6. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

It's no secret that I'll probably seek front-end employment following graduation.  Mastering CSS and all it's built in tools gives me the best avenue to develop skills most front-end employers seek.
