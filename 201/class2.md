# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  ***Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.***

# **Class 2 Assignment**

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

    Semantic elements give our code meaning.  Take for example \<h1>.  \<h1> is a semantic tag 
    that tells our page the text it wraps it’s a heading one element.  The \<span> tag on the other hand 
    is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document, which does not give 
    our code meaning, and therefore not semantic.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

    There are six heading elements: \<h1>, \<h2>, \<h3>, \<h4>, \<h5>, and \<h6>. Each element represents a different level of content in     the document. \<h1> represents the main heading while subsequent tags represent subheadings.

3. What are some uses for the \<sup> and \<sub> elements?

    Developers occasionally need superscript \<sup> and subscript \<sub> to mark dates, chemical formulas, and mathematical equations so     they have the correct meaning.

4. When using the \<abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

   A title attribute should be used to specify the element’s additional information.

5. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

    CSS can be applied using external or internal stylesheets, and also by using inline styling.  '

6. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

    We should avoid inline CSS styling for two reasons: 1) it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page, and 2) inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
