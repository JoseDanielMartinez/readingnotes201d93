# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  ***Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.***

# Class 3 Assignment

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

    The \<ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

    The list-style-type property command is applied to the element.  From there, the user agent selects a bullet type depending on the nesting level of the list.

3. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

    Developers change numbers on an ordered list by manipulating types.  You can change the type to type="1", which creates a numbered list starting from 1 or by changing the type "A", which creates a list numbered with uppercase letters starting from A.

6. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

    We should avoid inline CSS styling for two reasons: 1) it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page, and 2) inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
