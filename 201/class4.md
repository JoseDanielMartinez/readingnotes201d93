# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  ***Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.***

# Class 4 Assignment

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

    Basic links are created by wrapping the text or other content inside an \<a> element.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

    The href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

    a. Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.

    b. Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.

    c. Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

    d. Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.

    e. Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined.

    f. Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.

    e. Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

4. What is meant by “normal flow”?

    Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

5. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

    By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements — except for images.

6. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

    Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow.

7. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

    An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

    Elements behave differently. Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.

8. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

    Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), while fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

 

9. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

    Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

10. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.

11. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

    It allows programmers to work in concert with one another as a driver and navigator.  It helps work through problems, share knowledge, and see things from different perspectives.

    This could help me on my coding journey because I definitely don't know everything so it'll be nice to be mentored from time to time.  It'll make me a better coder.
