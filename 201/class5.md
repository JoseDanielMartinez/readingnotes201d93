# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  ***Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.***

# Class 5 Assignment

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

    A lossless WebP or PNG; JPEG if compression artifacts aren't a concern.  It should be based on quality compromise, especially when considering text.

6. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

    Foreground colors are what you want your HTML elements to be, and background colors are those which you'd like layered behind them.

7. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

    I'd change the body background color the entire HTML using

    \*{
      background-color: red
    \}

8. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

    Readibility and utility.

9. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

    Font size ses the font-size property.

    Font-weight sets how bold the text is.

    Font-style alters the text's shape, e.g. italicizing.
