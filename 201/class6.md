# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.
