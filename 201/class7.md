# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  ***Developers must be able to navigate DOM modeling so they can work on specific code issues.  Knowing tables is good because it's a rudimentary way of back up methods when our primaries are down.  Constuctors simply reduce time for productivity and lines of code for readability.***

# Class 7 Assignment

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

     It helps create a conceptual model in code for specific problems. A well articulated domain model helps verify and validate your understanding of problems.

2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

    It's not common practice anymore to use tables for page layouts.  Also, 1. layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, 2. they produce tag soup, and 3. they are not automatically responsive.

3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.

     \<th> table header- represents a table cell
     \<td> table data- the table cell's definition
     \<tr> table row- represents a table row

4. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

    A constructor is just a function called using the "new" keyword.  Reduces code lines and the need to update every property of objects.

5. How does the term "this" differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

    In an object, the term "this" will only return a function within it.  In a constructor, you can use it to call multiple returns.

6. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

    A prototype is a declaration that specifies its name and signature.  It would be like handing out a business card.  "Hello, I'm...and I specialize in..."

    An inheritance allows programmers to create classes built upon existing classes that specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors.  This would be like creating a cross functional team to a project.  While everyone works for the same company, the new team will have a specific purpose.
