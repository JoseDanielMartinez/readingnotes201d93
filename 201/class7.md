# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  ***XXX***
