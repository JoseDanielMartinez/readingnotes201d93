# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  Developers must be able to navigate DOM modeling so they can work on specific code issues.  Knowing tables is good because it's a rudimentary way of back up methods when our primaries are down.  Constuctors simply reduce time for productivity and lines of code for readability.  ***Flexbox is good to know for those beginner developers and bloggers.  It's a good starting point to understand the basics of how you can structure pages without always have to manipulate margins, borders, padding, and content manually.  Bloggers can add content to their pages easily to make them easily readible and add a little pop.  Personal business owners could also benefit from learning flexbox as well.  They can save a little money being their own developer and graphic designer.***

# Class 8 Assignment

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

   It simply excels at taking differently sized items and moves them around your page for the best layout.  It can be used to design basic webpages, such as blogs, articles, or collages with out the need to display more than text or pictures.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

    The cross axis will always run in the other direction of the main axis, so for example if your main axis is set to a flex-direction of "row, your cross-axis will display "column".

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

    it can hinder logical orders such as when using "row-reverse." The result may look good aesthecically but doesn't make sense.

4. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

    1. Time saving- write less code with fewer errors
    2. Less adjustments- Flexbox takes care of a lot of the formatting issues float can't.

5. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

    CSS is easier for me to understand than coding.  Makes me consider jobs in the front end or graphic design areas.
