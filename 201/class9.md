# ***Overview***

Before developers get to work designing websites, it's important they have ideal computer set ups, understand the basics, and apply solid programming fundamentals.  Understanding how to structure, style and animate webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript helps enhance users' experiences.  Arrays and loops also help developers interact with users.  Developers use both to create code that helps pull information and put it to use.  For example, correcting user responses.  Writing loops of code helps save time and minimizes errors.  Arrays help retrieve contained data for deployment.  Understanding HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layouts are important to know because as a developer, you'll be given problems to fix and knowing the areas well reduces time looking back through notes and having to research other's fixes, which may not be reliable to begin with.  Some problems you'll be called upon to troubleshoot are images and texts.  Learning to manipulate both makes user's web pages more appealing which increases more site visits and other metrics, e.g. views, hits, check-ins, etc.  Understanding Javascript objects helps developers save time when using functions in their code.  For example knowing when to use dot notations versus brackets and their advantages versus disadvantages. Constructors also save time.  They streamline the object process.  Having background knowledge about the document object model is important for developers to know because it gives them a visual representation of how their programming languages medify webpages.  Developers must be able to navigate DOM modeling so they can work on specific code issues.  Knowing tables is good because it's a rudimentary way of back up methods when our primaries are down.  Constuctors simply reduce time for productivity and lines of code for readability.  Flexbox is good to know for those beginner developers and bloggers.  It's a good starting point to understand the basics of how you can structure pages without always have to manipulate margins, borders, padding, and content manually.  Bloggers can add content to their pages easily to make them easily readible and add a little pop.  Personal business owners could also beneifit from learning flexbox as well.  They can save a little money being their own developer and graphic designer.  ***Learning forms helps developers interact and collect data from users.  Although collecting user data can become a rudimentary task, developers can manipulate forms to make them less boring or unappealing.  When users react to events, developers get an inside look at their behaviors.  This helps developers structure their pages to meet user needs, for example off the number of clicks, scrolls, or times a user visits urls.***

# Class 9 Assignment

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

   They first collect data from the user, but also puts them in the driver seat to control the interface.  Data is a large part of what drives most business models, whether it's for fiscal purposes, improve website accessibility, or to communicate with the user personally.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

    First and foremost is to think about how the user will view the page. Second is to keep it simple and uncomplicated. Third, is not to request more data than needed or to overwhelm the user.  Developers should first always plan out their forms before coding with some form of diagram.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

    - \<fieldset> creating widgets that share the same purpose, e.g. styling and semantic purposes
    - \<legend> formally describes the purpose of the fieldset tag it's nested within
    - \<label> helps screen readers and the disabled visualize content
    - \<h1> helps structure complex forms
    - \<section> further divide complex forms into seperate areas

4. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    Think of events as secrets.  They tell the developer about the user behind the scenes and helps the developer react to what they now know about the user.

5. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

   The name of the event and a function to handle the event.

6. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

   Event objects are parameters that automatically pass to event handlers to provide extra features and information.

   The target is useful because its a reference to the element the event will occur upon.

7. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

    The two are similar except that in event capturing the event fires first on the least nested element, and then on successively more nested elements, until the target is reached whereas with bubbling, the event fires first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested elements.
